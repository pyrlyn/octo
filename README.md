# Octo

An open, extensible desktop orchestrator for CLI coding agents. One window to run, watch and
coordinate several agents in parallel, each in its own git worktree, using your own agent
subscriptions.

Status: early development. See `docs/research.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and `plan/`.

## Build

Needs JDK 21.

```bash
./gradlew check      # build, tests, ktlint, detekt
./gradlew :app:run   # open the desktop app
```

To try Octo without installing an agent, turn on the built-in demo agent in `config.json` in
the Octo home (`OCTO_HOME`, or the platform's app data folder):

```json
{ "flags": { "demo-agent": true } }
```

`./gradlew ktlintFormat` fixes formatting. CI also builds every Kotlin/Native target with
`-Pocto.allNativeTargets=true`; locally only the host's native target is built.
